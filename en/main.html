          <div class="top-info-text">
            I’m a Front-End Developer with over two years of hands-on experience
            in building and optimizing websites.
            <br />
            During this time, I’ve worked on real-world projects and created
            portfolios that demonstrate how an initial idea can turn into a
            complete, functional website.
            <br />
            My focus has always been on three core principles: speed, SEO, and
            responsiveness — because a great user experience is more than just
            good design.
            <br />
            The code I write is clean, maintainable, and scalable, ensuring
            future improvements can be made effortlessly. Beyond work, I’m
            passionate about continuous learning and always strive to stay up to
            date — to become sharper and more precise every single day.
            <br />
            I’d be happy to collaborate on new projects and bring speed,
            stability, and genuine value to your business through attention to
            detail.

            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <p>
              builds the skeleton of every website — all the text, headings,
              images, and buttons are first defined with it. Without HTML, there
              is no page to display. But HTML is not just about putting tags
              together. A clean, well-structured code makes it easier for search
              engines to understand the site and rank it higher. It also ensures
              that future maintenance and development are faster and less
              costly. In my projects, I always focus on writing HTML that is
              clean, standard, and SEO-friendly. My approach ensures that the
              structure of the website is clear not only for users, but also for
              browsers and search engines. This means every site I build rests
              on a foundation that can be easily expanded and upgraded in the
              future.

            <h3>CSS</h3>
            <p>
              is the language that gives websites their look and feel. If HTML
              is the skeleton, CSS is the skin and style that makes everything
              visually appealing and user-friendly. Colors, fonts, spacing,
              animations, and even responsiveness are all handled through CSS.
              But it’s not only about looks. Well-structured and optimized CSS
              ensures that a website works correctly on every device and browser
              — from mobile phones to large monitors. In my work, I focus on
              writing clean, organized, and scalable CSS. This means that future
              updates or design changes can be made quickly and efficiently
              without breaking the site.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Flex-box && Css-grid</h3>
            <p>
              are the two main tools for layout in CSS. Flexbox is perfect for
              one-dimensional layouts (rows or columns) and makes alignment and
              spacing much easier. CSS-Grid, on the other hand, allows you to
              divide the page into a two-dimensional structure, giving complete
              control over both rows and columns at the same time. In my
              projects, I combine both approaches: Flexbox for smaller, flexible
              sections that need quick adjustments, and CSS-Grid for larger,
              more complex layouts. This combination ensures that websites look
              clean, modern, and fully responsive on all devices, from mobile to
              desktop. It also makes the design future-proof, allowing easy
              updates or redesigns when needed.

            <h3>SASS</h3>
            <p>
              is my go-to tool for writing professional, maintainable styles —
              it’s far beyond plain CSS. With Sass, I structure my code in
              modules, define custom variables and mixins, and keep the entire
              styling of a project under precise control. The advantage is
              clear: if the primary color or the size of an element changes, I
              don’t have to hunt through dozens of files. All key values (like
              colors, fonts, spacing) are defined once as variables, and
              updating that single variable automatically updates the entire
              project. This results in code that’s standard, fast, and scalable
              — exactly what’s needed for professional projects and future
              growth.

            <h3>JAVASCRIPT</h3>
            <p>
              is the core language that powers dynamic websites — it turns
              static pages into interactive and engaging experiences. With
              JavaScript, websites don’t just display information, they respond
              to users and feel alive. I work with modern JavaScript standards
              (ES6 and beyond), which allows me to write clean, maintainable,
              and scalable code. On top of that, I use JavaScript to handle
              server communication — fetching and sending data without reloading
              the entire page. This makes websites faster, smoother, and always
              up-to-date. For me, JavaScript is the bridge where design meets
              functionality, transforming a simple layout into a complete,
              interactive user experience.

            <h3>JQUERY</h3>
            <p>
              has been one of the most widely used JavaScript libraries, making
              web development faster and easier for many years. I’m familiar
              with jQuery and can maintain or update projects that still rely on
              it. That said, my main focus is on modern JavaScript (ES6+), since
              most professional projects today are built with newer standards.

            <h3>FIGMA</h3>
            <p>
              Every project begins with an idea. I use Figma to turn that idea
              into an initial, easy-to-understand draft — something you can see
              even before a single line of code is written. That draft becomes
              the roadmap and gradually turns into your real website; a site
              built exactly around your needs, without unnecessary gaps between
              design and execution.

            <h3>SEO</h3>
            <p>
              isn’t an optional skill — it’s a core pillar of any successful
              website. A site that doesn’t appear on Google is like a book that
              sits on a shelf but never reaches a reader. Beautiful design and
              advanced features mean nothing if nobody can find them. When I
              build frontend code, I apply SEO principles from the ground up:
              proper HTML structure, semantic tags, fast loading speed, and
              responsive design. The result is a website that doesn’t just look
              professional, but is ready to rank in search engines and attract
              real visitors. For any business, SEO is the difference between
              owning just a website and owning a powerful tool for growth and
              revenue.

            <h3>SPEED</h3>
            <p>
              Website speed is not a minor detail; it’s one of the most critical
              factors for success. Studies show that if a page takes more than a
              few seconds to load, users leave. Even search engines like Google
              treat speed as a key ranking factor. In my projects, I put strong
              focus on speed optimization: compressing images, minimizing code,
              leveraging caching, and writing lightweight styles and scripts.
              This results in websites that load fast and deliver a smooth,
              uninterrupted experience to users. At the end of the day, speed
              isn’t just about convenience — faster websites mean happier users,
              higher Google rankings, and better conversions for your business.

            The portfolio section showcases the real results of my work. Each

            Testimonials reflect the true quality of collaboration. A project’s
            outcome is defined not only by design and code, but also by the
            level of satisfaction throughout the process. Feedback is a key
            measure of my work, highlighting commitment, precision, and results
            — proving that each project represents not just a website, but a
            successful experience.

            This is where ideas take a real shape. I build websites that are not
            only beautiful but also fast and efficient. With a focus on SEO and
            responsiveness, every project stays future-proof. The code I write
            is clean, flexible, and easy to maintain. My goal is always to
            deliver quality that creates real value for your business.
